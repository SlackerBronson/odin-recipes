    <h2 class="header2">Description</h2>
    <p>Pad thai, phat thai, or phad thai, is a stir-fried rice noodle dish commonly served as a street food in Thailand as part of the country's cuisine. 
        As Thai's national dish, it is typically made with rice noodles, shrimp, peanuts, scrambled egg and bean sprouts. The ingredients are fried in a wok.</p>

    <h2 class="header2">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>1 bunch scallions</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup roasted, salted peanuts</li>
        <li>8 oz. dried flat pad Thai noodles or stir-fry rice noodles</li>
        <li>¼ cup tamarind juice concentrate (or 2 Tbsp. Thai tamarind paste mixed with 2 Tbsp. water)</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp. dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. fish sauce</li>
        <li>2 tsp. chili-garlic sauce, such as sambal oelek or sriracha, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp. vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 cups mung bean sprouts</li>
        <li>Lime wedges (for serving)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="header2">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>First, some prep: Cut 1 bunch scallions crosswise to separate dark greens parts from light green parts and bulbs. 
            Thinly slice scallions crosswise, keeping ends separate.</li>
        <li>Crack 4 eggs into a medium bowl and whisk to blend.</li>
        <li>Coarsely chop ⅓ cup peanuts.</li>
        <li>Place 8 oz. noodles in a medium heatproof bowl. Add boiling water to cover and let stand, tossing with tongs frequently, 
            until soft and pliable but not tender, 7-10 minutes (depending on brand). Drain and rinse with cold water, then drain again.</li>
        <li>Whisk ¼ cup tamarind concentrate, 3 Tbsp. brown sugar, 2 Tbsp. fish sauce, 2 tsp. chili-garlic sauce, and ¼ cup hot water in 
            same bowl you used to soak noodles.</li>
        <li>Pour 3 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet (at least 12" in diameter) and place over medium-high heat. Add eggs and cook, 
            stirring constantly, until dry curds form, 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add scallion whites, fish sauce mixture, and reserved noodles. Cook, tossing often with tongs, until sauce is mostly 
            absorbed and noodles are well coated, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Toss in scallion greens, 2 cups bean sprouts, and half of the chopped peanuts. Cook, tossing constantly, until heated through, about 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Divide noodle mixture among plates. Top with chili-garlic sauce and remaining peanuts. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing alongside.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately—and any time you're thinking about ordering delivery.</li>
    </ol>
